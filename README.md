## MATLAB Image Processing Utils

Some helpful functions for image processing in MATLAB, all documented for `help <function>`:

 * `show/` Tools for displaying multiple 2D and 3D images quickly
 * `ndops/` N-Dimensional generalizations of some operations
 * `wprob/` Weighted probability operations & histograms (N-D too)
 * `utils/` Miscelaneous functions

##### Worth Noting:

* `show / timshow.m` "tight imshow" - Show any number of 2D images with control over colormaps, spacing, and linear contrast.
* `show / volshow.m` "volume show" - Same, for 3D images, plus mouse wheel scrolling slices.
* `utils / biny` "bin y" - re-bin data with control over # levels and input / output limits.
* `utils / rdir` "recursive dir" - drill down any dir and return full pathnames to all files.
